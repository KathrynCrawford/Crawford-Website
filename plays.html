					<p>After several years of crop failure, twenty five year old high plains cotton farmer Rick Childress meets another disaster of nature by caving in to Toni's pleadings to sell the farm. His wife for five years, Toni finds it harder and harder to find the strength to live the farmer's life. She has labored to fulfill her husband's expectations, but the reality of this life has ground away all the hopes and dreams she had at graduation from college. A glimmer of hope presents itself when Rick agrees to sell after flooding shatters his hopes for this year's crop.

					But now, the morning after shows the promise of sunshine and Rick realizes he can't abandon the land and the life that is his heritage and legacy. To leave the farm would be to turn his back on his family, his home, and everything that defines who his is. What the two young people are left with is a choice neither wants to make. Rick sees the affect of the farm on his wife, yet his eternal optimism hopes for another crop that will clear their indebtedness and finally give his wife a life more comfortable than she's had to date. Toni, an outsider to his long relationship to the land, is more desperate to escape the constant doubt, toil, and stress of this type of life. The question they face together is larger than life on the farm, but life without each other.

					<p>Now in his mid–forties, Rick Childress has become a legend in his farming community as a crusty loner with a seemingly bottomless knowledge of cotton and the land. His farm is the epitome of success and his sole purpose now is to give his total attention to her. Resolute, determined–to–a–fault, proud, and a self–made hermit, Rick's only companion in life is Rafael, a periodic hired hand. This is the life he's made peace with until the new County extension agent arrives for a visit in the guise of Aggy Taylor, a transplant from the Kansas wheat fields.

				She is as forward and extroverted as he is reclusive and the legendary stories of the neighboring farmers about the hermit farmer intrigue her. Her presence and her curiosity act as fingernails on a chalkboard to Rick who seeks the fastest and most expedient method to rid the farm of her. His quandary is magnified when she discovers his personal collection of writings, poetry he has composed in an effort to deal with the ghosts of his past. Through his anger and resentment about her intrusion, much less his distaste for county extension agents, he discovers she, too, has a painful past life on a farm. His interest piqued, he must decide if there is enough room for anyone else to share his love of the farm.

His daughter, Maggie, expecting the farmer's first grandchild, wants him to retire and sell the farm before his love for the land kills him. After several sudden developments there are buyers for the farm, putting pressure on the old man to sell. Adding to this, Maggie discovers Rick’s health is not good, which increases her desire to get rid of the farm and have him move in with her. In the midst of this ever–developing problem, Rick receives a visitor to his rural Texas farm. Toni Childress, his first wife, enters the picture. Unheard from in forty years, she appears, anxious to dispel ancient ghosts. She has sought out Rick to join her on a journey through their past. His problems unknown to her, Toni becomes a harbor in a storm. She helps Rick through the difficult ordeal of deciding what a man must do when he has outlived his dreams.
