            <p>A timeless parable, as universal today as 2000 years ago, Prodigal tells of the Brileys, cattle ranchers in the heart of Texas where the “Piney Woods meet the Post Oak Savannah”. Faced with two major obstacles, Chrissy Briley labors to keep the ranch solvent in a failing market while harnessing a growing contempt for the cause of the financial crisis, her absent brother. Just as it seems the ranch may survive, the brother returns.</p>

              <p>It’s July 4, 1945, World War II is slowing to an end, and the boys and girls are coming home. Leaving for war as mere youths, these young men and women return, filled with angry nightmares but also dreams and plans, anxious to begin a life without war.  Such is life in the Whiting home. Theo, Sr. is blessed, having three sons and a daughter return. None lost. And he’s been busy. A self-made, rising above poverty, wealthy philanthropist, he welcomes his offspring home with positions and plans for their future. His well-meaning efforts are met with resistance and rebellion. His three sons: a bomber pilot, an army adjutant, and an infantry soldier have other plans. The daughter, a woman Marine, has seen the bright lights and big cities, and knows small town Texas is no place for a career-minded, modern woman.  “Father” has the personality, power, and savvy to finally subdue the “boys”, but is met by a force he never suspected when he attempts to manipulate his favored daughter.</p>

            <p style="font-weight: lighter">“I realize I’m writing about characters and events that are the epicenter to widely developed and well established belief systems. It is not my intention to persuade or disprove. It is my intention to illuminate. It is my belief that this event happened. It is my belief that these characters took part. Did it happen this way? The outline of events is based solely on the gospels. After much study and research, the storyteller in me wanted more. Spurgeon led the way. The 18th century English theologian, Charles Spurgeon, gave a sermon, “Gethsemane” in 1863 that encouraged and led me to this conclusion." - DWC</p>
